    Introduction:

"Good day everyone. Today, I'm excited to show you the enhancements made on our domain information platform. 
The focus of these updates is to enrich the details we provide for each domain, allowing our users to better understand and manage their domain statuses."

    Domain details:

"Let's start with the domain information page."

(Navigate to a domain information page)

"As you can see here, we've added several new columns to our table, 
providing much more detailed information for each domain."

    Validation started and expired dates:

"One of the new features we've added is the display of the validation dates. 
You can now see when the validation has been started, and also when it will expire."

(Point out the columns that show validation dates)

    Validation method:

"Additionally, the method of validation is also presented in the table. 
This gives you an idea of how the domain's validity was verified."

(Point out the validation method column)

    Wildcard allowed:

"One more exciting feature we've added is the indication of whether the domain allows usage of wildcard SAN in the certificate. 
If a domain name starts with a dot and the validation method is not File, it will be marked as 'Yes' in the 'Wildcard allowed' column, otherwise it will be 'No'."

(Point out the Wildcard allowed column)

    Search and sort:

"Of course, all these new columns support our existing features of sorting and searching, 
which helps users to manage domains effectively."

(Show some sorting and searching examples)

    Closing:

"We hope that these enhancements provide a more detailed and clear understanding of domain data, and improve our users' ability to manage and control their domains.
 As always, we're open to feedback and we'll continue to improve our platform for your needs. Thank you for your time!"
